# CS50_runoff

This repository contains my solution for the runoff election program as part of Harvard's CS50 course. The program is written in C and simulates a runoff election using ranked-choice voting.

CS50's runoff election program is an assignment where I was tasked with implementing a vote tabulation system that handles ranked-choice voting. The program should read voter preferences, conduct a runoff election, and determine the winner or handle tie scenarios.
